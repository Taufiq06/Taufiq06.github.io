title: "Object Detection using YOLO model"
excerpt: "Using dataset from a Kaggle machine learning competition, I wrote an algorithm to classify whether images contain either a dog or a cat. The Kaggle competition provided 25,000 labeled photos, which included 12,500 dog photos and an equal number of cat photos. The dataset was originally developed by Microsoft. I used Keras API to solve this problem. I took two approaches: (1) train a model from scratch (2) use transfer learning to train a pretrained model. For the first approach, I followed the general architectural principles of the VGG models. I stacked three convolutional layers with 3Ã—3 filters followed by a max pooling layer to create each block and repeated the process to create a three block network. Other important hyperparameters involved 'same' padding, 0.001 learning rate, and 'binary cross-entropy' as the loss function. For the second approach, I loaded a VGG-16 model, removed the fully connected layers, froze the weights of all of the convolutional layers, and trained new fully connected layers using the Kaggle dataset. The second approach produced a higher accuracy in a shorter time.<br/><img src='/images/predict_car_2.PNG'><br><sub><sup>I used the model to detect cars in my driveway!
