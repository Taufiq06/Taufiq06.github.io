title: "test"
excerpt: "During my time with the NASA DEVELOP program, I worked on a project to identify the change in vegetation health in Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica. Osa Peninsula is a very biodiverse area, but it was under threat because of logging and agricultural efforts. So, their government implemented a Forest law in 1996 to protect the ecosystem of Osa. We created time-series land use land cover (LULC) maps for that region to assess the impacts of restoration efforts. Our maps helped the local conservation team to educate the public, inform environmental policy decisions, and support the restoration of biodiversity in the Osa region.<br/><img src='/images/predict_car_2.PNG'><br><sub><sup>I used the model to detect cars in my driveway!
