title: "Create A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to Classify Photos of Dogs and Cats"
excerpt: "Using dataset from a Kaggle machine learning competition, I wrote an algorithm to classify whether images contain either a dog or a cat. The Kaggle competition provided 25,000 labeled photos which contained 12,500 dog photos and an equal number of cat photos. The dataset was originally developed by Microsoft. I used Keras API to solve this problem. I took two approaches to solve the problem: (1) train a model from scratch (2) use transfer learning to train a pretrained model. For the first approach, I folowed the general architectural principles of the VGG models. I stacked 3 convolutional layers with 3Ã—3 filters followed by a max pooling layer to create each block and repeated the process to create a 3 block network. Other important hyperparameters involved 'same' padding, 0.001 learning rate and 'binary cross-entropy' as loss function. For the second approach, I loaded a VGG-16 model, removed the fully connected layers, froze the weights of all of the convolutional layers and trained new fullty connected layers using the Kaggle dataset. The second approach produced a higher accuracy in a shorter time.<br/><img src='/images/history_comp_kaggle_cat_dog_model_5-25_plot.png'><br><sub><sup>Training history for the two approaches.</sup></sub><br/><img src='/images/pred_pt_vgg16_kaggle_cat_dog_model_5-25.png'><br><sub><sup>I classified photos of some of my co-workers pets using the 2nd model!</sup></sub><br><sub><sup>Credit: The source code was adapted from [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/)</sup></sub>"
