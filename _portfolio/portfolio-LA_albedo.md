title: "Measuring Urban Surface Reflectivity and Heat Mitigation Potential at High-Resolution with Remote Sensing and Machine Learning"
excerpt: "At WRI, I worked on a project to identify the surface reflectivity of roofs and pavements in urban areas using machine learning. This was an AI for Earth project funded by Microsoft. For this project, we developed our workflow using Python in Azure Cloud environment. We used aerial imagery from National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) and the models were trained on Azure Machine Learning Studio.<br/><img src='/images/albedo_gif.gif'>"
