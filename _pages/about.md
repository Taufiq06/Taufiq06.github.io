I am currently a PhD student at Auburn University. My research interests include geospatial data analysis using computer vision and machine learning. Currently, I am focusing on developing improved evapotranspiration monitoring, forecasting, and modeling at an unprecedented level by harnessing emerging satellite remote sensing, machine learning and numerical weather predictions. 

Before joining Auburn University, I worked for the Cities team at WRI. Here, I worked on several projects that involved developing machine learning solutions for remote sensing problems. I received my M.S. in Environmental Engineering from the University of Georgia. While doing my masters, I worked as a Research Consultant at NASA DEVELOP program.
