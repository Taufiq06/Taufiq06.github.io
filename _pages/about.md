I am currently working as a Research Assistant at the World Resources Institute (WRI). I support the data team at Resource Watch through creating and troubleshooting scripts to update and upload datasets on the Resource Watch platform. [Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/) is an open, freely accessible, online global data platform that provides trusted and timely data for a sustainable future.

My research interests include geospatial data analysis using computer vision and machine learning. I am passionate about the application of artificial intelligence to the field of remote sensing for solving geospatial problems. Before joining Resource Watch, I worked for the Cities team at WRI. Here, I worked on several projects that involved developing machine learning solutions for remote sensing problems.

I received my M.S. in Environmental Engineering from the University of Georgia. While doing my masters, I worked as a Research Consultant at NASA DEVELOP program.
