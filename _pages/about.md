I am currently a PhD student at Auburn University. My research interests include geospatial data analysis using computer vision and machine learning. My current research focuses on developing improved evapotranspiration monitoring, forecasting, and modeling at unprecedented level by harnessing emerging satellite remote sensing, machine learning and numerical weather predictions. I am passionate about the application of artificial intelligence to the field of remote sensing for solving geospatial problems. 

Before joining Auburn, I worked for the Cities team at WRI. Here, I worked on several projects that involved developing machine learning solutions for remote sensing problems. I received my M.S. in Environmental Engineering from the University of Georgia. While doing my masters, I worked as a Research Consultant at NASA DEVELOP program.
