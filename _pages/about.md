I am currently working as a Research Assistant at the World Resources Institute (WRI). I support the data team at Resource Watch through creating and troubleshooting scripts to update and upload datasets on the Resource Watch platform. [Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/) is an open, freely accessible, online global data platform that provides trusted and timely data for a sustainable future.

Before joning Resource Watch, I worked for the Cities team at WRI. 

I received my M.S. in Environmental Engineering from the University of Georgia. While doing my masters, I worked as a Research Consultant at NASA DEVELOP program.
