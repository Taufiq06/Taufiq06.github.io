I am currently a PhD student at Auburn University. My research interests include applying artificial intelligence, satellite imagery, and machine learning in order to develop precise evapotranspiration models, land use and land cover maps, and climate datasets for effective urban planning, water management, and other natural resource management. Currently, I am focusing on developing improved evapotranspiration monitoring, forecasting, and modeling by harnessing emerging satellite remote sensing, machine learning and numerical weather predictions. ET data can be used to measure how much water moves from the earthâ€™s surface into the atmosphere every day. This information is very important in many fields, such as agriculture, forestry, water management, monitoring droughts, managing wildfires, etc. 

Before joining Auburn University, I worked for the Cities team at WRI. Here, I worked on several projects that involved developing machine learning solutions for remote sensing problems. I received my M.S. in Environmental Engineering from the University of Georgia. While doing my masters, I worked as a Research Consultant at NASA DEVELOP program.
